# Food-Planner
I'm not a fan of shopping, especially grocery shopping.  So I've always liked to plan my meals by month, and just do one grocery run a month accordingly.  In the past, I've done this with Excel, but in pursuit of learning more Java I'm trying to make a simple Android application that can accomplish this grocery planning with total user ease. :)
